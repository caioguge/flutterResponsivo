## 💻 About the project

Responsive Flutter - Was a module in **Start to Dev** ministered by the professor **Daniel Ciolfi**, who taught us how to consume an API, (in this case, an API created by us, the students). The comments in this project is in Portuguese-BR, however you can search for the traslation later.


The entire project was desenvolved in the dart console.

## 🚀 How to execute

### Pre requirements

Before starting, you will need to have the Git tool installed on your machine:
[Install Git](https://git-scm.com).

Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
<br>

Having completed the previous steps, let's proceed.

```
